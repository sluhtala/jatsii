# Jatsii
My version of the yahtzee dice game.
I created it for educational purposes with html and javascript.

[Rules of the game](http://www.yahtzee.org.uk/rules.html)

After first roll, you can click a dice to lock and unlock it.

Rules says that you can roll dice 3 times maximum but in this it is possible to roll it as many times you want.

It is also possible to write your own scores but you can click a checkbox to automatically calculate any score.
